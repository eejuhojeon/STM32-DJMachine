List of Functions:
Play an audio file.
o WAV files are read from micro-SD cards by SDIO interface and FATFS from micro-SD Module
o Audio data are modified by Digital Audio Processing on the STM32 processor.
o Internal DAC reads processed audio data from memory by using Direct Memory Access (DMA)
o DAC is controlled by internal timers, and output signal amplified by LM386 amplifier
o Amplified audio signal is sent to external speaker to play the audio.

Real-time digital signal processing on STM32 processor
o Audio tempo adjustment from x0.5 ~ x1.5
o Low pass filter / High pass filter application with adjustable cutoff frequency (64 â€“ 16384Hz)
o Real-time audio mixing of four inherent sound effects.
o Play & Pause, audio time control, selecting audio file to play.

Device control by external physical inputs
o Audio sound volume control by adjusting variable register connected to LM386 amplifier.
o Audio tempo control by potentiometer using ADC.
o Filter application, sound effects, play/pause, audio file selection by GPIO interface
o Audio time control can be done by buttons communicating with STM32 by GPIO interface.
